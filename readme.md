#QuickBlog
## A super lightweight text-based blog system
# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS YET - IT WON'T WORK!

QuickBlog uses very lightweight code to create a super-simple no-database blogging system. It uses HTML5, PHP and AJAX

###How does it work?
QuickBlog stores each blog post as a simple HTML file on your server. The home/main page of your blog will quite simply grab all of the post files and display them in date order for you. Because it's so lightweight and simple, it's very easy to upgrade and change to suit you.

###Limitations
This was a quick project for me and therefore there are a number of features I wish to change

* Cannot currently handle editing. Plans to implement this very soon
* Currently all posts are stored in the root. Plans to make directories
* Cannot handle multiple posts with the same post title, it'll just overwrite them
* Currently has no login system
