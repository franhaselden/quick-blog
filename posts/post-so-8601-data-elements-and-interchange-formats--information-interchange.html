<h2 class="post-title">SO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange</h2>
			<h3 class="publish-date">22 October 2014</h3>
			<div class="content"><p class="content">In general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the Gregorian (and potentially proleptic Gregorian) calendar, times based on the 24-hour timekeeping system (including optional time zone information), time intervals and combinations thereof.[1] The standard does not assign any specific meaning to elements of the date/time to be represented; the meaning will depend on the context of its use. In addition, dates and times to be represented cannot include words with no specified numerical meaning in the standard (e.g. names of years in the Chinese calendar) or that do not use characters (e.g. images, sounds).[1]
<br /><br />
In representations for interchange, dates and times are arranged so the largest temporal term (the year) is placed to the left and each successively smaller term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of Arabic numerals and certain characters (such as \"-\", \"W\", and \"Z\") that are given specific meanings within the standard; The implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as \"January\" or \"Thursday\", are not allowed in interchange representations.</p></div>
